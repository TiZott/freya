FREyA is a Natural Language Interface for Querying Ontologies
FREyA is an interactive Natural Language Interface for querying ontologies which combines usability enhancement methods such as feedback and clari
cation dialogs in an attempt to: 1) improve recall by generating the dialog and enriching the domain lexicon from the user's vocabulary, whenever an "unknown" term appears in a question 2) improve precision by resolving ambiguities more effectively through the dialog. The suggestions shown to the user are
found through ontology reasoning and are initially ranked using the combination of string similarity and synonym detection. The system then learns from the user's selections, and improves its performance over time.
