Q: I would like to learn about FREyA, where do I start?

A: The short summary of FREyA accompanied with Mooney dataset evaluation can be found in this paper:
D. Damljanovic, M. Agatonovic, H. Cunningham: Natural Language Interfaces to Ontologies: Combining Syntactic Analysis and Ontology- based Lookup through the User Interaction. In Proceedings of the 7th Extended Semantic Web Conference (ESWC’10), Springer Verlag, Heraklion, Greece, May 31-June 3, 2010.

The other paper which focuses on the portability - configuring FREyA to work with 
huge datasets. It explains how to port FREyA to DBpedia and MusicBrainz:
D. Damljanovic, M. Agatonovic, H. Cunningham: FREyA: an Interactive Way of Querying Linked Data using Natural Language. In: Pro- ceedings of 1st Workshop on Question Answering over Linked Data (QALD-1), collocated with the 8th Extended Semantic Web Confer- ence (ESWC’11). Heraklion, Greece, June 2011.

Also, Chapters 9 of my thesis largerly covers the above papers, but perhaps has some more details:

Q: How can I turn off disambiguation dialogue in FREyA?

A: You can use askNoDialog method from FreyaService - if you call localhost:8080/freya/index-auto.html
that should do it.

Q: Does FREyA understand multiple sentences?

A: No. However, there is a partial support in FREyA for multiple sentences/questions. There is some work left to be done in order to have it working properly.
